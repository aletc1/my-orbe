## Before opening a PR

All three checks must pass:

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript validation across all packages
pnpm lint        # ESLint
pnpm test        # Vitest unit tests
```

**PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — this repo uses squash-merge, so the PR title becomes the commit on `main` and drives automated versioning via release-please.

```
<type>[optional scope][!]: <short description>
```

Quick reference: `feat:` → minor bump, `fix:` → patch bump, `feat!:` / `fix!:` → major bump (breaking change). `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `test:` produce no release. See [CLAUDE.md §Release process](./CLAUDE.md#release-process) for the full table and rules.

## Adding a streaming provider

Providers that can be implemented as a background service (credential-based polling) follow this path:

1. **Add the key** to `PROVIDER_KEYS` in `packages/shared/src/types/status.ts`.
2. **Implement the `Provider` interface** under `packages/providers/src/<name>/provider.ts`.
3. **Add fixtures** under `packages/providers/test/fixtures/` for unit tests.
4. **Register ingest handlers** in `apps/api/src/routes/providers.routes.ts` (the `INGEST_ENABLED_PROVIDERS` set and any provider-specific mapping).
5. **Register connect/test/disconnect** in `apps/api/src/routes/services.routes.ts` (the `PROVIDER_INSTANCES` map).
6. **Seed the provider** — add an `enabled: true` row in `packages/db/src/seed.ts`.

For browser-captured providers (where the server never holds long-lived credentials, as with Crunchyroll and Netflix), the ingest side lives in the Chrome extension instead of a background worker. Implement a `ProviderAdapter` in `apps/extension/src/providers/` and register it in `apps/extension/src/providers/index.ts`. Use the Crunchyroll adapter (`crunchyroll.ts`) as the reference implementation.
